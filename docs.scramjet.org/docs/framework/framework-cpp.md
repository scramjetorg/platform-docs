## Installation

To use Ifca interface library just clone framework-cpp repository and add include directory to your project then simply include headers of your need.

## Usage

Write and read chunks:

```cpp
std::shared_future<void> write(Chunk chunk)
```

- writes chunk of type Chunk to ifca algorithm (must be the same type as input type of first transform). Returns drain state- if we've surpressed [maxParallel] chunk processed, it will return shared_future to wait for draining stream, otherwise returns already set shared_future.

```cpp
std::future<OutputType> read()
```

- Returns future of processed chunk of type OutputType- type returned by last transform in chain. Future is set after transformations are finished.

Transform chunks:

To add Transform to processing chain use:

```cpp
 addTransform(Transform)
```

Transforms accept any callable object having operator(ChunkType value) overloaded- functions, member functions, lambdas, std::function, functional objects.

Possible values are:

```cpp
 each(Callable function)
```

- Calls Callable(chunk) and passes result of callable further.

```cpp
 map(Callable function)
```

- Calls Callable(chunk) and passes same chunk further without taking result of callable.

```cpp
 filter(Predicate function)
```

- Calls Predicate(chunk)- must return bool value. If predicate is true passes chunk further, otherwise filters out chunk from flow.

Example usage:

```cpp
  // for readability only
  using namespace ifca;

  auto incrementByOne = [](int chunk) {
    return chunk + 1;
  };
  auto showChunk = [](int chunk) {
    std::cout << chunk << "\n";
    return chunk;
  };
  auto filterOddChunk = [](int chunk){
      return (chunk % 2 == 0);
  }

  const unsigned int maxParallel = 8;

  auto ifca = Ifca().addTransform(map(incrementByOne)).addTransform(each(showChunk)).addTransform(filter(filterOddChunk));

  auto inputReader = std::async(std::launch::async, [&]() {
    int c;
    while (std::cin >> c) {
      ifca.write(c).wait();
    }
    ifca.end();
  });

  auto outputReader = std::async(std::launch::async, [&]() {
      while (true)
        std::cout << ifca.read().get();
  });
  outputReader.wait();

```

## Requesting Features

Anything missing? Or maybe there is something which would make using Scramjet Framework much easier or efficient? Don't hesitate to fill up a [new feature request](https://github.com/scramjetorg/framework-cpp/issues/new)! We really appreciate all feedback.

## Reporting bugs

If you have found a bug, inconsistent or confusing behavior please fill up a [new bug report](https://github.com/scramjetorg/framework-cpp/issues/new).

## Contributing

You can contribute to this project by giving us feedback ([reporting bugs](#reporting-bugs) and [requesting features](#reporting-features)) and also by writing code yourself!

The easiest way is to [create a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) of this repository and then [create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) with all your changes. In most cases, you should branch from and target `main` branch.

Please refer to [Development Setup](#development-setup) section on how to setup this project.

## Development Setup

1\. Clone this repo:

```bash
git@github.com:scramjetorg/framework-cpp.git
```

2\. List presets available on your OS:

```bash
cmake --list-presets=all .
```

It will result with a similar list:

```bash
Available configure presets:

  "linux-debug"         - Linux Debug
  "linux-test-coverage" - Linux Test Coverage
  "linux-release"       - Linux Release
```

3\. Build `make` according to specific preset:

```bash
cmake --preset linux-debug
```

4\. Build project using `make` file from previous step:

```bash
cd out/build/linux-debug/
cmake --build .
```

5\. Run tests (only debug presets)

```bash
./tests/IFCA_tests
```
