# Manage the Sequence

## Use data input and output

Scramjet Cloud Platform (SCP) can handle various inputs. As a developer, you are free to process any of them in your Sequence applications, such as: Text, JSON, XML, SOAP, Audio, Video and more. Inputs can be either:

1. Provided to Hub via its REST API
2. Consumed from various local or remote sources by the app; such as: Stream, STDIN, File, API, URL
3. Generated by the app itself

```bash
si instance input <id> [<file>]
# the instance id or '-' for the last one started or selected.
# the input file (stdin if not given default)

```

Our engine outputs can be managed in several ways:

1. File - you can save your output to a local or a remote file
2. STDOUT - output can be directed to system STDOUT (STDERR is supported as well)
3. API - output can be consumed from our SCP REST API
4. URL Request - you can write your app in a way to request URL, webhook etc
5. Stream - output can be streamed to a particular destination

You can mix multiple actions together: you can both send data to remote system/URL and save it locally.

To pipe running instance output to stdout:

```bash
si instance output <id>
# the instance id or '-' for the last one started or selected.
```

## Use Control Messages

Control the Sequence and send data to it thanks to the messages described below.

| CODE                | DESCRIPTION                                                                                          |

### Monitoring health check

Information about the Sequence overall health (including information about functions).

```bash
cat test.txt | curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "[5001, {2000}]" http://localhost:8000/api/v1/sequence/health
```

```json
{
  "healthy": true,
  "sequences": [
    {
      "throughput": 0.1,
      "buffer": 0,
      "processing": 3,
      "pressure": 30
    }
  ]
