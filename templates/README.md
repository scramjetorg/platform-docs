# Templates

We have prepared for you some templates. User templates allow you to apply predefined settings to start building your own applications. Using templates, you can easily set up multiple applications with similar settings.

You can use it as a base for your own samples üëâ [sample template](https://github.com/scramjetorg/scramjet-cloud-docs/tree/HEAD/templates). For this moment we support two variants of template in two programming languages:

- [Python (yyy... python?) üëâ Scramjet Sequence template](https://github.com/scramjetorg/scramjet-cloud-docs/tree/HEAD/templates/template-js)
- [JavaScript (Node.js) üëâ Scramjet Sequence template](https://github.com/scramjetorg/scramjet-cloud-docs/tree/HEAD/templates/template-js)
- [TypeScript (ts-node) üëâ Scramjet Sequence template](https://github.com/scramjetorg/scramjet-cloud-docs/tree/HEAD/templates/template-ts)

In the following sections we will describe both templates' contents and show you how they can be used in your own project.

## Work with JavaScript (Node.js)

This application package template contains two files:

- **package.json** - this file holds all the important information about the project in plain JSON Object format. It contains human-readable metadata about the project (like the project name and description) as well as functional metadata like the package version number or dependencies required by the application.`package.json` file is one of the basic requirement to have in the root of every project. This is the heart of any Node.js project, used by the application to find its dependencies to install, scripts to run, etc. If you would like to start your project from scratch, without using our js-template, you would need to create a directory and run `npm init` inside. This command would create a `package.json` file for you with all the obligatory properties, for example:

```json
{
  "name": "sample-project",  // the name of the project
  "version": "1.0.0",        // the version of the project
  "description": "",         // a short description of the project
  "main": "index.js",        // the entry point/file of the project
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"  // the script to run tests, you can add more scripts to this object
  },
  "author": "",              // the author of the project
  "license": "ISC"           // the license of the project
}
```

Of course more properties can be added to this object if you need them, such as `dependencies` and `devDependencies`. Dependencies are simply all the other modules that your project will use. In template's `package.json` file there is one more property `"repository"`, which shows the repository address, where the source code of the package is located.

ü§ì If you would like to learn more about the configuration in Node.js projects, please refer to the documentation on [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.dev/learn/introduction-to-nodejs).

- **index.js** - this is where you should put your code and all the logic of the application you create. It will be the entry point of your application. In our template we introduce you to a very straight forward application, which simply reads input stream and write it to the output stream.

```js
const { PassThrough } = require("stream");

module.exports = function(input) {
      /*
    THIS IS WHERE YOU SHOULD PUT YOUR CODE, AND ALL THE LOGIC OF YOUR APPLICATION
    We put some code below for demonstration, and also instructions to run this template with scramjet-transform-hub (STH).
    */

    // create a clean output stream
    const out = new PassThrough({encoding: 'utf-8'});

    input.on("data", data => {
       // write some data to the output stream
        out.write(data)
    });
    // return the output stream so it can be consumed (e.g. by CLI client)
    return out;
};
```

This is what our template app does, it takes any input that will be sent or piped to it and simply writes it to the output stream. Of course you can add some logic to this function, but to keep the template simple we will just write the data to the output stream.

To see how this template works you can run it with a few simple commands written below:

> üí° **Note!** To run this template you need to have those two packages installed: `npm install -g @scramjet/sth @scramjet/cli`

### **Open 3 terminals** and run the following commands and let the magic begin ü™Ñ

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ terminal:

- run command `scramjet-transform-hub`

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ terminal:

- `cd templates`
- `si pack template-js`
- `si seq send template-js.tar.gz`
- `si sequence start -` which is the same as `si sequence start <sequence-id>`
- `si q output -` which is the same as `si q output <q-id>`

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ terminal:

The command below will run the app in the background. The app generates random numbers from 1 to 10 and write them to q's `/input` endpoint (to q which will be run on STH). In this way we are sending an input stream that will be consumed by our template app.

- `node ./tools/stream-gen-tool/numbers-gen.js <q-id>`

### **Expected output:**

![template1](../images/template1.png)

What you can see in the attached image is 3 terminals that illustrates the template's workflow:

Terminal 1Ô∏è‚É£ shows the logs of running `scramjet-transform-hub` process.

Terminal 2Ô∏è‚É£ shows the output of the program that we launched using STH CLI.

Terminal 3Ô∏è‚É£ shows the output of the `node` command that runs the app which generates random numbers and sends them to the q's input.

## Work with TypeScript (ts-node)

TypeScript compiles to JavaScript. It is a superset of JavaScript, which means that you can use all the features of JavaScript plus some new features and advantages of TypeScript, then compile it and get regular JavaScript.

This application package template contains files:

- **package.json** - function of this file is similar to `package.json` file in [JavaScript template](##Work-with-JavaScript-(Node.js)) with a small but ‚ùó**VERY IMPORTANT**‚ùó difference. The file given in `"main"` property must be typed in without any extension, like in the example below. This is because this `package.json` will be copied into the `dist` directory, which eventually will be archived into a `.tar.gz` format and sent to the STH.

```json
{
  "name": "@template/template-ts",
  "private": true,
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index",   // the entry file MUST be named without any extension!
  "description": "This package is a User's template for ts-node projects",
  "author": "Scramjet <open-source@signicode.com>",
  "license": "GPL-3.0",
  }
```

- **tsconfig.json** - it is a crucial file for managing your project,it creates itself after running `tsc --init` command, which initializes the TypeScript project. This file is where you can set the compiler options. Basically this is an indicator for TypeScript, which says that the project in which this file lies and all the other sub folders should be managed by TypeScript and it also tells Typescript how to compile all the `*.ts` files in the project.

```typescript
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true
  },
  "include": [
    "./index.ts"
  ]
}
```

ü§ì If you would like to learn more about the configuration in TypeScript projects, please refer to the documentation on [TypeScript official website](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html) and [ts-node official website](https://typestrong.org/ts-node/).

- **dist** - this is a folder where the compiled JavaScript files will be stored. It will be created after running this script: `npm run build` together with compiled `index.js` file.

- **package-json.lock** - this is automatically generated file, which represent any operations where npm modifies either the node_modules tree, or package.json. It describes the exact tree that was generated, such that subsequent installs are able to generate identical trees, regardless of intermediate dependency updates.

- **index.ts** - this is where you should put your code and all the logic of the application you create. It will be the entry point of your application.
This file will be compiled into manila JavaScript and stores in `index.js` file in `dist` directory.

In our template we introduce you to a very straight forward application, which simply reads input stream and write it to the output stream.

> üìñ In the example below we use `@scramjet/types` module. Scramjet is a very nice and functional stream programming framework. You might find it very useful while writing your app or dealing with streams in general. More info, examples and usage you can find [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/scramjet).

```typescript
import { ReadableApp } from "@scramjet/types";
import { PassThrough } from "stream";

const app: ReadableApp<string> = async function(input) {
    /*
    THIS IS WHERE YOU SHOULD PUT YOUR CODE, AND ALL THE LOGIC OF YOUR APPLICATION
    We put some code below for demonstration, and also instructions how to run this template 
    with scramjet-transform-hub.
    */

    // create a clean output stream
    const outputStream = new PassThrough({ encoding: "utf-8" });

    input.on("data", data => {
        // write some data to the output stream
        outputStream.write(data)
    });
    // return output stream so it can be consumed (e.g. by CLI client)
    return outputStream;
};

export default app;
```

This is the minimal signature for a function that takes a stream and returns a stream.

```typescript
<T,U>(inp: ReadableStream<T>, ...args: any[]) => AnyReadable<U>
```

And this is what our template app does, it takes any input that will be sent or piped to it and simply writes it to the output stream. Of course you can add some logic to this function, but to keep the template simple we will just write the data to the output stream.

To see how this template works you can run it with a few simple commands written below:

> üí° **Note!** To run this template you need to have those two packages installed: `npm install -g @scramjet/sth @scramjet/cli`

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ terminal:

- run command `scramjet-transform-hub`

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ terminal:

- `cd templates/template-ts`
- `npm install`
- `npm run build` - it runs build script in the template's package.json file, which compiles Typescript to JavaScript
- `cp -r node_modules/ package.json dist/` - it copies node_modules and package.json to the dist folder
- `si pack dist` - it creates a tar.gz archive of the dist folder
- `si sequence send dist.tar.gz` - it sends the archive to STH
- `si sequence start <sequence-id>` - it starts the Sequence (started Sequence turns into Instance)
- `si inst output <instance-id>`- it shows the Instance's output stream in the terminal

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ terminal:

The command below will run the app in the background. The app generates random numbers from 1 to 10 and write them to q's `/input` endpoint (to q which will be run on STH). In this way we are sending an input stream that will be consumed by our template app.

- `node ./tools/stream-gen-tool/numbers-gen.js <q-id>`
