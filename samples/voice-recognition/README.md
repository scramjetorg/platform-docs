# voice recognition

This is a simple and trivial example of voice recognition with Scramjet and speech_recognition Python library.

___

## Prerequisites

Our sample needs some external dependencies to run properly, however we are packing them in sample. The one thing that you need to run this sample is dependency needed by our **listen.py** script, to gather audo data from your microphone.

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-pyaudio
```

> ðŸ’¡**NOTE:** Packaging of Python Sequences is not very "pythonic" for now. If you have any idea, how we should resolve it for your comfort, please let us know [here](https://github.com/scramjetorg/transform-hub/issues/598).

## Running

Open two terminals and run the following commands:

**The first terminal:**

```bash
# start sth
DEVELOPMENT=1 scramjet-transform-hub
```

Thanks to **DEVELOPMENT** flag, you will be able to see sample output on terminal with STH logs.

**The second terminal**

```bash
# go to 'voice-recognition' directory
cd samples/voice-recognition

# install dependencies
yarn build:refapss

# Deploy sample to STH
si seq deploy dist/
```

> ðŸ’¡**NOTE:** Command `deploy` performs three actions at once: `pack`, `send` and `start` the Sequence. It is the same as if you would run those three commands separately:

## Output

```bash
# You need to pass instane id to listen.py script. Gather it first
si inst ls
[{"id":"da9e41d8-e776-491f-b883-6e61afa93b97","sequence":"15228e0e-b7e3-4008-b4ee-e9aa1d0008d9"}]

# You should see something similar to this. Now you can start talking :)

For test purpose, I said that ***I like pink elephants***. You can notice that it is visible in STH logs.
