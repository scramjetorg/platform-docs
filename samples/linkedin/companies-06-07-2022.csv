Instead of doing 3D content manually, we will turn 2D product images into 3D models automatically - all that comes with a monthly subscription fee. AI solution, as what we have, is capable of creating a 3D model even from 1 single shot image which makes the solution hardware independent and extremely scalable. Our solution is benefiting from multi-stage hybrid deep neural networks which are creating point clouds, fit meshes and make deformable models and with minimal manual tuning it results in a web-shop quality level textured 3D model 3D model reconstructed from 2D image can provide realistic online shopping experience, facilities new e-commerce applications where the consumers try and buy products while avoiding visiting physical shops. 3D model reconstructed from 2D image provides the ability to the consumers to look at the 3D object from any point of view and visualize it in the real environment using augmented reality devices. Such shopping experience is beneficial to several disadvantaged groups, both nationally and internationally, including individuals with reduced mobility and those living in remote areas, by providing a realistic shopping solution. Also, in a time of pandemic, e-commerce with augmented reality (AR) technology could help to order products by virtually trying and testing before ordering. In particular, such technology has been playing an important role across the world over the recent Coronavirus outbreak. One of the biggest challenges in virtual and augmented reality as well as the 3D game industry is creation of 3D models. The challenge exists due to the fact that 3D models usually need to be created manually from one of multiple 2D images and this manual work is not only time consuming but also very expensive. Our mission is to be the leader who helps to bring augmented reality into masses. We are working diligently to become the leading 3D creation platform by making 3D affordable and scalable.",,,723000,EUR,796868,Seed,803000,EUR,887075,723000,EUR,796868,Seed,Seed,"ZAKA Startups, Curiosity VC",,,261,"1,338",info@alphaar.io,+37256637621

The Sustainability and Social Risk Monitors launched in 2022 are the first affordable tools to uncover trends from millions of voices in real time, enabling clients to detect and contextualize social changes.
